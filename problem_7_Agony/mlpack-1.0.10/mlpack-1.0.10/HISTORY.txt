2014-08-29    mlpack 1.0.10

  * Bugfix for NeighborSearch regression which caused very slow allknn/allkfn.
    Speeds are now restored to approximately 1.0.8 speeds, with significant
    improvement for the cover tree.

  * Detect dependencies correctly when ARMA_USE_WRAPPER is not being defined
    (i.e., libarmadillo.so does not exist).

  * Bugfix for compilation under Visual Studio.

2014-07-28    mlpack 1.0.9

  * GMM initialization is now safer and provides a working GMM when constructed
    with only the dimensionality and number of Gaussians (#314).

  * Check for division by 0 in Forward-Backward Algorithm in HMMs (#314).

  * Fix MaxVarianceNewCluster (used when re-initializing clusters for k-means)
    (#314).

  * Significant speedups for dual-tree algorithms using the cover tree (#243,
    #329) including a faster implementation of FastMKS.

  * CF (collaborative filtering) now expects users and items to be zero-indexed,
    not one-indexed (#324).

    recommendations as the first parameter.  The number of users in the local
    neighborhood should be specified with CF::NumUsersForSimilarity().

  * Refactor LRSDP into LRSDP class and standalone function to be optimized
    (#318).

  * Fix for centering in kernel PCA (#355).

    constructor, trained, or set manually with HMM::Initial() (#315).

  * Added Nyström method for kernel matrix approximation by Marcus Edel.

  * Kernel PCA now supports using Nyström method for approximation.

  * Ball trees now work with dual-tree algorithms, via the BallBound<> bound
    structure (#320); fixed by Yash Vadalia.

  * The NMF class is now AMF<>, and supports far more types of factorizations,
    by Sumedh Ghaisas.

  * A QUIC-SVD implementation has returned, written by Siddharth Agrawal and
    based on older code from Mudit Gupta.

  * Added perceptron and decision stump by Udit Saxena (these are weak learners
    for an eventual AdaBoost class).

  * Sparse autoencoder added by Siddharth Agrawal.

2014-01-06    mlpack 1.0.8

  * Memory leak in NeighborSearch index-mapping code fixed (#310).

  * GMMs can be trained using the existing model as a starting point by
    specifying an additional boolean parameter to GMM::Estimate() (#308).

  * Logistic regression implementation added in methods/logistic_regression (see
    also #305).

  * L-BFGS optimizer now returns its function via Function().

  * Version information is now obtainable via mlpack::util::GetVersion() or the
    __MLPACK_VERSION_MAJOR, __MLPACK_VERSION_MINOR, and  __MLPACK_VERSION_PATCH
    macros (#309).

  * Fix typos in allkfn and allkrann output.

2013-10-04    mlpack 1.0.7

  * Cover tree support for range search (range_search), rank-approximate nearest
    neighbors (allkrann), minimum spanning tree calculation (emst), and FastMKS
    (fastmks).

  * Dual-tree FastMKS implementation added and tested.

  * Added collaborative filtering package (cf) that can provide recommendations
    when given users and items.

  * Fix for correctness of Kernel PCA (kernel_pca) (#280).

  * Speedups for PCA and Kernel PCA (#204).

  * Fix for correctness of Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA) (#289).

  * Added a ridge regression option to LinearRegression (linear_regression)
    (#298).

  * Gaussian Mixture Models (gmm::GMM<>) now support arbitrary covariance matrix
    constraints (#294).

  * MVU (mvu) removed because it is known to not work (#189).

  * Minor updates and fixes for kernels (in mlpack::kernel).

2013-06-13    mlpack 1.0.6

  * Minor bugfix so that FastMKS gets built.

2013-05-01    mlpack 1.0.5

  * Speedups of cover tree traversers (#243).

  * Addition of rank-approximate nearest neighbors (RANN), found in
    src/mlpack/methods/rann/.

  * Addition of fast exact max-kernel search (FastMKS), found in
    src/mlpack/methods/fastmks/.

  * Fix for EM covariance estimation; this should improve GMM training time.

  * More parameters for GMM estimation.

  * Force GMM and GaussianDistribution covariance matrices to be positive
    definite, so that training converges much more often.

  * Add parameter for the tolerance of the Baum-Welch algorithm for HMM
    training.

  * Fix for compilation with clang compiler.

  * Fix for k-furthest-neighbor-search.

2013-02-08    mlpack 1.0.4

  * Force minimum Armadillo version to 2.4.2.

  * Better output of class types to streams; a class with a ToString() method
    implemented can be sent to a stream with operator<<.  See #164.

  * Change return type of GMM::Estimate() to double (#266).

  * Style fixes for k-means and RADICAL.

  * Handle size_t support correctly with Armadillo 3.6.2 (#267).

  * Better tests for SGD (stochastic gradient descent) and NCA (neighborhood
    components analysis).

2012-09-16    mlpack 1.0.3

  * Remove internal sparse matrix support because Armadillo 3.4.0 now includes
    it.  When using Armadillo versions older than 3.4.0, sparse matrix support
    is not available.

    (#254), including stochastic gradient descent (#258).
