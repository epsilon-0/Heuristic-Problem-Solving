The attached zip file contains all of the source and compiled code to produce solutions

Copy the zip file to an energon machine and unzip:
> unzip ShortestVector.zip
> cd ShortestVector

The GenMat.jar in this directory is the tool used to generate solutions.
You can invoke it with three command line arguments <input> <output>:
> java -jar ShortestVector.jar input1.in input1.out

If necessary you can rebuild the jar file by using the included ant build script:
> ant clean
> ant

Other Helpful Hints:
We also supplied an automation script which can generate results for all test data
and evaluate the results.  Assuming that all of the inputs are in:
    data/
and that the grader program is located at:
    spec/evaluathor.jar
    
Then you can run:
$ chmod 755 test_and_score_all.sh
$ ./test_and_score_all.sh
This will store solutions in soln/ and output results for each test.
