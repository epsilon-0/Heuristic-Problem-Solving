lk-0.4.0 is the first public release of LK.
	- lk implements Lin-Kernighan for the TSP and min-weight perfect matching.
	- Most TSPLIB files are understood.  (GEO is still a mystery to me)
	- Iterated-LK is supported via the -i switch.
	- tspgen generates TSPLIB-format instances from a list of weights.
	- shake perturbs a 2-d TSPLIB-format instance by articulating some
of the large edges in a MST for that instance
	- jitter perturbs a 2-d TSPLIB-format instance by adding noise to the
coordinates of its vertices
	- ifs generates 2-d TSPLIB instances based on iterated function systems.
The input format is rather sparse and should be updated to the DIMACS IFS
format.  (I didn't know the DIMACS format existed when I wrote ifs.w.)
	- The script directory contains many useful scripts for
generating and transforming instances, for running experiments,
and for massaging the output of experiments.  There's also an embryonic
TSP Perl class.
	- The Makefile in the expt directory is godawful ugly and requires GNU
make to be functional.  It was a hack to get automatic generation of gnuplot
files from experiment logs.
