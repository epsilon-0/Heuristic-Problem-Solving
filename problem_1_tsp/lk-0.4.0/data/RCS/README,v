@Files with names ending in ".tsp" are sample inputs taken from TSPLIB
(insert references).  

STSP.html is the list of best values known for symmetric TSPLIB
instances.  This was downloaded on June 19, 1997 from the TSPLIB web
site.

Files ending in ".ifs" are specifications for iterated function systems.
They are processed with program ifs to generate instances in TSPLIB format.
