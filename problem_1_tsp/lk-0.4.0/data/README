Most files with names ending in ".tsp" are sample inputs taken from TSPLIB
(see http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/iwr/comopt/soft/TSPLIB95/TSPLIB.html). 
Files fullgrid*.tsp are regular grids of points, and files unifd*.tsp
are uniform random grids of points.

STSP.html is the list of best values known for symmetric TSPLIB
instances.  This was downloaded on June 19, 1997 from the TSPLIB web
site.  

Files ending in ".ifs" are specifications for iterated function systems.
They are processed with program ifs to generate instances in TSPLIB format.
	(Should convert to use DIMACS IFS format.)
The .ifs files provided here are named according to what I think
the output looks like.  Ok, don't go doing a Rhorschack test on me now!
(How *do* you spell that?)
