Authors of LK.

David Neto (netod@acm.org) wrote LK in support of the experiments in
his PhD work.  The error handling routines, some memory macros, and the
TSPLIB file reading routines are reused from related work from 1994 and 1995.
LK itself was begun in early 1996.

Donald Knuth wrote gb_flip.w.  It is the random number generator for
The Stanford GraphBase.  See the book by the same name, ISBN 0-201-54275-7.
David Neto wrote gb_flip.ch to provide function prototypes.

dsort includes code published by Jon Bentley and Doug McIlroy in their
paper, _Engineering a Sort Function_, Software Practice and Experience.

Of course LK was inspired by the descriptions of Shen Lin and Brian
Kernighan and of David Johnson, Jon Bentley, Lyle McGeoch, .. Rothberg,
.. Ostheimer.
