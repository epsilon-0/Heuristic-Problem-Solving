/* Sometimes small procedures are expanded in-place in order to save the
 * time overhead of a function call and return.  That is called inlining.
 *
 * However, inlining usually expands code, possibly causing the instruction 
 * cache to be less effective.  In those cases, inlining can slow down the
 * code.  Hence the choice.
 *
 * If PRNG_DESIRE_INLINING is non-zero, then use inlining if the compiler 
 * supports it.
 *
 * Well, it seems that inlining slows down the code a whole lot on a SPARC,
 * but speeds things up on my Intel 486 Linux box.

@Inlining is faster on Intel 486, but slower on Sparc.
(Sparc 4 sunbeam.cs anyway)
