 * 
 * 
 * This file sets the compile-time options for the program LK.  Behaviour
 * or availability of certain parts of the program LK are enabled or
 * modified here by defining C preprocessor symbols.  The defaults are
 * given in comments.
 * 
 * Warning!  This file is *not* generated by a web file.  It is a plain .h
 * header file so that the user who doesn't have ctangle installed (tsk,
 * tsk!) has the ability to change the configuration options for the
 * program LK.  That said, I've tried to make this file as self-documenting
 * as possible without the power of CWEB or TeX.
 * 
 * Some of the options from this file depend on definitions in config.h,
 * the package-wide configuration header file.  That file is generated
 * automatically at configuration time, and knows a lot about the target
 * system.  So files that include this header file should include
 * <config.h> first.  (See the Autoconf manual for why it one should use
 * angle brackets (#include <config.h>) instead of ordinary quotes
 * (#include "config.h").)
 * 
 * Generally speaking, the first ``word'' in a symbol name corresponds to
 * the source file that it affects.  For example, ERROR_NO_CHECK controls
 * the behaviour of part of the error module in file error.w.  Sometimes
 * the name is abbreviated, e.g. KD_CHECK_VERBOSE controls behaviour of the
 * k-dimensional trees defined in kdtree.w.
 * 
 *
 * This file is divided into sections, most important first.  They are:
 *  Options to control algorithmic parameters.
 *  Options to control precision and accuracy.
 *  Options that may have an impact on performance, but not on correctness.
 *  Options to control the amount of memory used.
 *  Options to select options for repeatability -- good for experiments.
 *  Options to control in some way the amount of output generated.
 *  Options to control how much checking is done.
 *
