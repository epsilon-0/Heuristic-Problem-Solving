 * This file sets the compile-time options for declustering support.
 * I've designed a way to compensate for clustering present in the TSP
 * instance.  It is explained in decluster.w (and in my PhD thesis).
 *
 * Define JBMR_DECLUSTER_IN_ELIGIBILITY_TEST to compensate for clustering
 * when deciding whether an edge is feasible.
 *
 * Define JBMR_DECLUSTER_IN_GREEDY to compensate for clustering when
 * choosing among eligible edges.  If the GREEDY setting is on, then the
 * ELIGIBILITY setting must also be on.
 *
 * Defaults:
	#define JBMR_DECLUSTER_IN_ELIGIBILITY_TEST 1
	#define JBMR_DECLUSTER_IN_GREEDY 1
