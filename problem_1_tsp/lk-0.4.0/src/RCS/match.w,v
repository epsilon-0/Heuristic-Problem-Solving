Revision 1.12  1998/05/18 20:33:18  neto
Added Iterated part of Iterated Lin-Kernighan.
Oddly enough, it seems that iterated lk for matching doesn't find
any better tours than ordinary lk.  I used a sequential 4-change
as the mutator, but that doesn't seem rich enough, although
*occasionally* it takes a number of tries to get back to the previous
optimal.

Revision 1.11  1998/02/13 19:34:03  neto
Removed the extraneous output.

Revision 1.10  1998/02/07  22:22:49  neto
Fixed 2 bugs:
1.  Edito: accidentally zeroing out en[two i] at start of every generic
part of search.  Ouch.
2.  Was not checking cum gain test on only t2ip1.  That's important.
3.  Had the cum pos and cum neg reversed in setting them.
This appears to work well.  Now I need to remove (or verbosize) some
debugging output.

virtual pointers should never be 0, which is NULL.

Added lots of debugging output (again!)
Fixed two bugs:
1.  Wasn't doing the bookkeeping for filling in e rows correctly.
2.  Was using the *least* attractive move first.  (Now *there*'s an idea)
Fixed that by reversing the sense of the eligible comparison function.

Revision 1.7  1998/02/06  16:39:57  neto
Much more debugging output.
Fixed bug: wasn't quitting search early enough in backtracking depths.
Fixed bug: wasn't checking (t2i,t2ip1) against (t2ip1,t2ip2) in tabu check.

@@*Minimum Weight Perfect Matchings.
It would be nice if declustering worked for more than just Lin-Kernighan
on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
So I'm going to try it for minimum weighted perfect
matchings.

A \term{matching} on a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a set of edges $M$ 
contained in $E$ with the property that for all vertices $v\in V$,
at most one edge $e\in M$ is incident upon $v$.
A \term{perfect matching} for $G$ is a matching $M'$ for $G$ in which
for all 
vertices $v \in V$, there is exactly one edge in $M'$ incident upon $v$.
Now, this is only possible when the number of vertices is even;
furthermore the number of edges in a perfect matching is half the number
of vertices of the underlying graph.
@@^matching@@>
@@^perfect matching@@>
@@^weighted matching@@>

Now suppose each edge $e$ has an associated cost, say |cost(e)|.
Then we may make the convention that the weight of a set $E'$ of edges
is the sum of the weights of its members, \ie, $\cost(E')=
\sum_{e \in E'} \cost(e)$.
Then 
we may ask for 
a minimum-weight perfect matching.
There are polynomial time algorithms for finding optimal answers,
but here we implement a heuristic that should find good answers quickly.

We will only be considering undirected graphs, and therefore assume
that the cost function is symmetric.

@@ Why weighted perfect matchings?

First, the Lin-Kernighan algorithm retains its spirit when translated from
the TSP to this setting.  The same cumulative gain criterion can be used.
I believe it has the same flaw and the same fix.

Second, the TSP is an NP-hard problem.  Its solution space is therefore
quite treacherous.  Weighted perfect matching is polytime-solvable.
In fact, 
algorithms that backtrack in to find augmenting paths
always find optimal solutions in $O(n^3)$ time or better.
In particular, this fixed search strategy shows that the solution space
is well-behaved.  So it would be nice to show that declustering might
help a Lin-Kernighan style heuristic in these well-behaved spaces as
well as in the spaces defined by NP-hard problems.

Third, as a practical matter, one would not want to run a cubic algorithm
on an instance of size 100000.  Just as with NP-hard problems, one might
prefer a good solution in a short time rather than an optimal solution
in a very long time.

Fourth, weighted perfect matchings have very local structure.  
This removes most of the tedium of coding the Lin-Kernighan heuristic.
At least, I hope it does.  We don't need the complicated case structure
of Lin-Kernighan in the context of the TSP.

@@ If you are new to the Lin-Kernighan algorithm, I suggest you read
their paper first.  If you can't make heads or tails out of that, 
read Johnson and McGeoch's chapter in {\sl Local Search in Combinatorial
Optimization}, 1997.
If that too fails and you still want to understand the heuristic,
read this module before reading the \module{JBMR} module.

This routine implements the Lin-Kernighan idea for minimum weight perfect 
matching.  It is a local search routine that repeatedly tries to find
improvements known as $k$-changes.  A $k$ change is the removal of $k$
edges and the addition of $k$ edges.

The $k$-changes sought by Lin-Kernighan are of a special nature.
The edges involved the $k$-change form an even-length cycle, where deleted
edges alternate with added edges.
We label the vertices involved in the $k$-change
$t[1]$ through $t[2k]$, where $(t[1],t[2])$ is the first edge removed from the
current matching, and $(t[2],t[3])$ is the first edge added to the matching.
Lin and Kernighan called such a structure a \term{sequential $k$-change}
because one may construct it incrementally from $t[1]$ on upward.

@@ It will be convenient to represent |t| as an array.

Lin and Kernighan observed that without loss of generality, one 
may restrict the search to those in which the \term{cumulative gain criterion}
applies, \ie, in any prefix of the $t$ array, the deleted edges outweigh 
the added edges.

We define the \term{cumulative gain} to be the total weight of the deleted
edges minus the total weight of the deleted edges.
If the |length_t| length type is an exact representation, then the 
cumulative gain is stored directly in the variable |cum_gain|,
\ie $$\hbox{|cum_gain|}= 
\sum_{1 \le s < 2i, s {\rm\ odd}}
\cost(t[s],t[s+1])%
-
\sum_{1 \le s < 2i, s {\rm\ even}} 
\cost(t[s],t[s+1])%
.$$
The first sum is the weight of the deleted edges;
the second sum is the weight of the added edges.

Unfortunately, we sometimes have to deal with inexact representations
for numbers, \eg,
types |float| or |double|.  In those cases it turns out that it is better
to store the positive and negative parts separately.

Macro |CAREFUL_CMP(LHS,OP,RHS)| compares the left hand side |LHS| with
the right hand side |RHS| using arithmetic operator |OP| and evaluates
to a boolean value.

We use ANSI C's token pasting operator |##| to automagically transform 
the variable names in the left and right-hand sides appropriately.   This
forces all uses of the macro to use variable names only for the two sides
of the comparison.

Furthermore, we'll be using the concept of an \term{instance epsilon} to
protect against other numerical nasties.   If we're using exact
representations, then the value of the right-hand side should just a

@@*1 Backtracking.
Successful application of the Lin-Kernighan variable-depth idea demands
that we backtrack when no improvement is found.  For example, if a search
beginning with a particular quadruple $(t[1],t[2],t[3],t[4])$ yeilds no
improvement, then we substitute some other pair 
in place of $t[3]$ and $t[4]$ and try again.  
@@^backtracking@@>

The best implementations of Lin-Kernighan for the TSP backtrack over all
possibilities up to $t[6]$ and occasionally over some possibilities for 
up to $t[8]$.  But the constraints of maintaining a tour, or something
close to a tour, makes the case analysis quite involved and error-prone.
That difficulty translates into the code, where the depth of backtracking
is usually hardcoded.

In the case of perfect matchings, the changes are localized enough that 
the case analysis is obviated: all the cases are regular.  So we can afford
to encode the backtracking in a generic way, and allow the caller to
specify the depth of the backtracking.  The parameter |backtracking_levels|
records an integer specifying which is the last position in the |t| 
at which to perform backtracking.  Specifically, we backtrack over all
possibilities for $t[2j+1]$ whenever $1 \le j \le \hbox{|backtracking_levels|}$.
Note that a value of zero for |backtracking_levels| specifies that no
backtracking should be done at all.

@@*1 Basic moves.
A sequential $k$-change is built by appending pairs of vertices to the 
|t| array.  The current end of the |t| 
list is indicated by the value of variable |two_i|, which is always even
and at least 2.  That is, edges 
$(t[1],t[2]), (t[3],t[4]), \ldots, 
(t[2i-1],t[2i])$ are deleted edges, and
$(t[2],t[3]), (t[4],t[5]), \ldots, 
(t[2i-2],t[2i-1])$ are added edges.

Given a candidate for |t[2i+1]|, |t[2i+2]| is determined; in fact 
|t[2i+2]| is always the current mate of
|t[2i+1]|.  
The cumulative gain criterion says we 
can add the pair of |t[2i+1]| and |t[2i+2]| to the |t| list
if the current cumulative gain plus 
|-cost(t[2i],t[2i+1]) + cost(t[2i+1],t[2i+2])| is positive.


@@*1 Greedy choice.
Given a list of candiates for |t[2i+1]| (and their mates), Lin-Kernighan
prioritizes them according to which gives the greatest gain (or least
reduction) in the cumulative gain.  To make prioritization convenient,
we storing the pairs with their auxiliary information
in an array and sorting them before choosing to explore any of them.

Type |eligible_t| records the candidate pair of vertices
in fields |t2ip1| and |t2ip2|.  
The cumulative gain resulting from the choice of using |t2ip1| and |t2ip2|
as $t[2i+1]$ and $t[2i+2]$ is recorded in field |gain| (or
the pair |gain_pos|, |gain_neg| if the gain variables are split).

In |gain_1| (or |gain_1_pos| and |gain_1_neg|), we 
record the gain after adding only |t2ip1| to the list.

Field |cluster_distance| is the cluster distance between |t[1]| and |t2ip2|.
It is only used when the declustering feature is turned on.

To compare eligible moves, it is convenient to boil the gain down into one 
field the value of the gain, regardless of whether the gain variables are
split.  That field is |gain_for_comparison|.

(Note that module \module{JBMR} has its own version of type |eligible_t|,
which has the extra complication of recording the case analysis scheme
required by that eligible move.    We don't need that here because the
perfect matching cases are all uniform.)

\ie, it encodes a move choosing $t[l+1]$ and $t[l+2]$.
Beware that |l| tracks the value of |two_i| and hence will only ever
be even and positive.

Given a choice for |t[2i]|, the candidates for |t[2i+1]| are taken
from a list of those vertices close to |t[2i]|.  The candidate lists
are precomputed by routines in module \module{NN}.  Here we need to
know the maximum length of any candidate list, because that is an upper
bound on the width of the backtracking at any one level.

@@ To prevent endless cycling, Lin and Kernighan used two rules:
$$\hbox{Never delete an added edge}$$
and
$$\hbox{Never add a deleted edge.}$$

In their recent experiments,
Johnson, Bentley, McGeoch, and Rothberg keep the first rule and
discard the second;
the first rule alone is sufficient to limit the
search to a depth of roughly $n$ steps.  

In Papadimitriou's proof of the PLS-completeness of Lin-Kernighan for
the TSP, he discards the first rule and keeps the second; the second
rule alone is sufficient to limit the search to a depth of $O(n^2)$ steps.
I know of no implementations of Lin-Kernighan for the TSP that use only
the second rule.

I call the first rule the JBMR tabu rule, and I call the the second rule
the Papadimitriou rule.

For consistency with the \module{JBMR} module, I implement the JBMR rule.
In the perfect matching case it would be easy to implement the Papadimitriou
rule instead (or as well).  

In more concrete terms, the JBMR rule says that see that 
edge $(t2ip1,t2ip2)$ does not appear as $(t[2k],t[2k+1])$ anywhere on
the current list, nor as the proposed new edge
$(t[two_i],t2ip1)$.  All these edges are taken
to be undirected.  

Since the overwhelming majority of searches are shallow, I use a linear
time low-overhead tabu check instead of a more elaborate logarithmic time
check.

@@ There are two reasons for we stopping the search from |t[2]|.
First, we've exhausted the possibilities without finding an improvement.
In that case, we've already undone all the moves, and we've nothing left
to do.

Second, we have found an improvement to the perfect matching.  
That's what this section is about.  It unwinds the changes from the search
down to the level where the best improvement was discovered, and implements
the last offshoot in that improvement.  (Actually, we might be undoing
the offshoot and then reimplementing the offshoot again, but 
checking whether that has happened is more difficult than just redoing
the work, especially because the mate data structure is so trivial.)

@@*Iterated Lin-Kernighan.
In order to be able to revert to a previous solution, we either record
the previous solution in its entirety or just the differences between
solutions.  I choose to record just the differences.

The log is an array of integers, formatted as follows.  The log
contains an encoding of all the $\lambda$-changes applied during this iteration,
in order from first $\lambda$-change to last $\lambda$-change.  Each $\lambda$-change
is encoded as the values $t[1]$ through $t[best_two_i]$, followed by
|best_exit_a|, |best_exit_b|, and then finally |2+best_two_i|.  We need
this last value so we can find the boundary of the record of
this $\lambda$-change while
unrolling the changes.

But we only record those differences if there is something to revert
back to, \ie, only if this is not the first iteration.

@Added Iterated part of Iterated Lin-Kernighan.
Oddly enough, it seems that iterated lk for matching doesn't find
any better tours than ordinary lk.  I used a sequential 4-change
as the mutator, but that doesn't seem rich enough, although
*occasionally* it takes a number of tries to get back to the previous
optimal.

@@*Basic moves.
A sequential $k$-change is built by appending pairs of vertices to the 
|t| array.  The current end of the |t| 
list is indicated by the value of variable |two_i|, which is always even
and at least 2.  That is, edges 
$(t[1],t[2]), (t[3],t[4]), \ldots, 
(t[2i-1],t[2i])$ are deleted edges, and
$(t[2],t[3]), (t[4],t[5]), \ldots, 
(t[2i-2],t[2i-1])$ are added edges.

Given a candidate for |t[2i+1]|, |t[2i+2]| is determined; in fact 
|t[2i+2]| is always the current mate of
|t[2i+1]|.  
The cumulative gain criterion says we 
can add the pair of |t[2i+1]| and |t[2i+2]| to the |t| list
if the current cumulative gain plus 
|-cost(t[2i],t[2i+1]) + cost(t[2i+1],t[2i+2])| is positive.

@@*Greedy choice.
Given a list of candiates for |t[2i+1]| (and their mates), Lin-Kernighan
prioritizes them according to which gives the greatest gain (or least
reduction) in the cumulative gain.  We make this prioritization convenient
by storing the pairs with their auxiliary information
in an array and sorting them.

The |eligible_t| type records the pair of vertices
in fields |t2ip1| and |t2ip2|.
