Revision 1.26  1998/02/19 18:12:46  neto
Removed const from prototype to make it match with the functino definition.

Revision 1.25  1997/12/17 16:22:08  neto
Fix the very long usage printing lines so they typeset better.

Revision 1.24  1997/12/06 19:54:55  neto
Fixed POSIX SOURCE defintion thingie.  Also, fixincludes is definitely
in the same directory.

Revision 1.23  1997/12/06 15:46:38  neto
Fixed to compile on Linux (and hopefully still on Solaris). It seems *I*
have to declare optarg...

Revision 1.22  1997/12/01  15:33:57  neto
No wonder the program was ignoring its random number seed: it hadn't
been processing the command line until *after* the generators were
initialized!

Revision 1.21  1997/11/27  19:11:58  neto
Rail exp to 1 when necessary
Attempt at clean fix of getopt and friends config.

Revision 1.20  1997/11/20 19:22:40  neto
Better comments.  Also, I fixed the sense of t in mediating alpha and beta.
(Comments do wonders for correctness.)
Also, the usage message now describes -j briefly.

Revision 1.19  1997/11/20 18:16:31  neto
If join length bias is 1, then make sure we don't loop enlessly.
Alas, the curse of intervals closed on the right...
Also, don't rotate c unless it's the last component.

Revision 1.18  1997/11/20 16:52:43  neto
Better presentation: cleaned up verbose output in Graham scan, and
added options info to COMMENT field of the output.

Revision 1.17  1997/11/20 16:15:55  neto
Fixed an ooops.

Revision 1.16  1997/11/20 16:15:08  neto
Added hull join point length bias.  It compiles but is untested.

Revision 1.15  1997/11/20 14:28:09  neto
Added better option handling, including packing factor from the command linee,
and help.
The hull-vertex picking code and matching code is better checked.

Revision 1.14  1997/11/14  22:54:05  neto
I know why must sort edges smallest to largest: to preserve the MST lengths.
(e.g. (0,0) (5,0), (0,1) (5,1))
We use a prev bias to try to generate more compact clones.

Revision 1.13  1997/10/11 17:50:28  neto
It seems we must sort the lengths into ascending order. Why? I don't know.
Now default is debugging off.

Revision 1.12  1997/10/11 17:18:55  neto
Added more consistency checks.

Revision 1.11  1997/10/11 15:07:23  neto
This mostly works, but it gets a few edge lengths wrong.

Revision 1.10  1997/09/27 19:24:28  neto
Made the TSPLIB output more conformant.

Revision 1.9  1997/09/27 18:01:42  neto

@@*TSPGEN.
This program generates a TSP instances.  The input is $n$ followed by
$n$ positive numbers interpreted as lengths.  
The generated instance has a
minimum spanning tree (MST) whose set of edge lengths is the same as the input
set of lengths.

@@ I have a hunch that the set of TSP instances generated in this way from the
same input data are reasonable clones of each other in the eyes of 
the Lin-Kernighan heuristic.  That is, Lin-Kernighan has consistent execution
behaviour over such clones.

Furthermore, I have a hunch that projecting a given TSP instance down
to its set of MST edge lengths and then generating 
new TSP instances from that
set is a reasonable way to generate clones of the original instance.

\book{Characterization and Parameterized Generation of

@@ There are a few command line parameters.  

Option \type{-h} provides help, then exits successfully.

Option \type{-s} takes a mandatory integer paramter used as the random
number seed.  Actually, we use three independent random number streams, 
but each is initialized with a seed generated deterministically from the
command-line specified seed.  The default seed is, of course, $-42$.

Option \type{-j} takes a floating point parameter used as the 
\term{join length bias}.  When gluing components together, we can join
them at whatever hull points we like.  If the join length bias is negative,
then we join them at a randomly chosen hull point.  
However, experiments show that this leads to very sparse fractal-like
structures.   
(I'm out of practice at this, but my eyeball estimate is that the Hausdorff
dimension is quite low: about 1.05.)  
If we always join hulls at a point adjoining the longest edge on the hull,
then the resulting instance has a much tighter structure.  
We'd like some flexibility on this choice, and the join length bias gives
us that flexibility.  If the bias is negative, then each hull join point is
chosen randomly.  Otherwise, the bias should be between 0 and 1,
representing a fraction used to choose from a sorted list of the hull edge
lengths: a bias of 0 means always pick the shortest edge on each hull,
a bias of 1 means always pick the longest edge.  
The default bias is 1, so that the default is to
try to create the tightest instance possible.
This parameter is used
in conjunction with the packing factor.

Option \type{-p} takes a floating point parameter used as the 
\term{packing factor}.  Once each hull point and its associated edge of
interest is chosen, we can choose from a range of angles at which to 
rotate the component before joining.  This has some effect over how
tightly the points in the instance are packed.  The packing factor must
be non-negative.  Smaller factors bias the angles toward looser packing,
and higher factors bias the angles toward tighter packing.

@@*Agglomeration.
We generate a clone by agglomeration.  That is, we mimic Kruskal's 
minimum spanning tree algorithm.  Kruskal's algorithm begins with isolated
vertices and repeatedly adds a next shortest edge that does
not create a cycle.  

However, Kruskal's algorithm projects information away, namely all the
discarded edges.
Our task is to build a coherent structure around the minimal information
we're given.   Furthermore, we are given only the edge lengths, and not
how the edges are connected.

This program generates only two-dimensional Euclidean instances, even
though its input might not have been projected down from a Euclidean instance.
I hope this restriction is not too damaging.

@@ The algorithm is as follows.  Begin with isolated vertices, and then
perform the following steps until the list of lengths is exhausted.

Of course, there may be many variations on this.  First, one might
want to sort the lengths into increasing order.  This might result in
more compact clones.  This is likely most easily implemented in a 
preprocessor to this program, \eg, a Perl script.

Second, we might want to bias the chosen components
in some way.  For now, components are chosen at random.
Looking at its output, this may have to change.  For example, 
TSPLIB instance \type{pla7397} has two bands of very tightly packed points,
with increasingly sparse points in between.  Choosing components randomly,
the short MST
edges become widely distributed, cluster-wise.  That's an
unfaithful representation of the cluster structure of the instance.
I suppose I shall have to carry more of the MST structure through to
the generated instances.

@@*1 Convex hulls.
To ensure that the resulting TSP instance has the same set of MST edge
lengths, the vertices joined are chosen from the convex hull of the components.
So each component must know its own convex hull.

A convex hull is an ordered set of points.  We will represent each hull by
a circular linked list.  
Since there are up to $n$ points in all the hulls, the linked
lists for all the hulls are just independent threads in an array 
of vertices named |hull_vertex|.

Each entry of |hull_vertex| represents a vertex in its hull list.
A vertex in this context knows its Euclidean coordinates
(stored in fields |x| and |y|)
and its successor and predecessor in the list 
(stored as pointers |next| and |prev| to
other elements of
array |hull_vertex|).  Each vertex is identified by its position in the
array.

@@*1 Connected components.
A component must know its points and its hull.    These are stored
separately.  That is, a point in the interior of the component is
stored only once, and a point on the hull is stored once in the point
collection and once in the hull.

@@
In addition to being connected by edges, 
components will be geometrically translated and rotated.
In fact, each time a component is joined with another component, one of them
will be translated, both will likely be rotated, and then
their convex hulls merged.  The transformed coordinates of the hull points
must be known in order
to compute the new convex hull, but we don't need to know the exact
coordinates of each interior point until the end of the program
execution
when we write the output.  

So we can save a lot of computational 
effort by updating internal point coordinates lazily.  That is, when
a component is transformed, we store its transformation for later processing;
in contrast, we transform hull coordinates eagerly.  When it comes time
to write the cooridinates, we apply the accumulated transformations
on each point.

@@ As components are merged, they form a binary tree.  
Leaves represent individual vertices.  Untransformed vertices are always
at the origin, so there is no need to store them explicitly.

its hull.

Here's where we rotate a component with a bias.
Let's name the component |comp| and its hull point |comph =comp->hull|.
We rotate |comp| so that |comph| is at the bottom, \ie, its |y| coordinate
is the least of any |y| coordinate of points in |comp|.

We have some freedom in picking the angle used to rotate the component.
There are two cases: the forward direction, and the backward direction.
The forward direction is as follows.
At one extreme, angle |alpha| lays the vector from |comph->prev| 
to |comph| at angle
0 (\ie, parallel to the $x$ axis and pointing toward positive infinity).
At the other extreme, angle |beta| 
lays the vector from |comph| to |comph->next| at angle 0.

The backward direction interchanges the roles of |alpha| and |beta|.

Hulls are oriented counter-clockwise.  
That is, following |next| pointers results
takes you around the hull while making left-hand turns.    

Of course, if there's only one point in the hull, then there's nothing to do!

I used to randomly choose an angle from a uniform distribution over 
$[\alpha,\beta]$, but that seemed to generate very sparse and stringy
instances.

So 
I introduced a positive number |packing_factor|, used to bias the
choice between |alpha| and |beta|.  A factor of 1 specifies a uniform
distribution.  Higher factors specify a tighter packing, and
lower factors specify a looser packing.  But we're still at the mercy
of randomization.  The packing factor is a hint.

In fact, if $y$ is in $[0,1]$, we set $t= y^p$, where $p$ is the
non-negative packing factor.  When $p$ is near zero, $t$ is biased toward
1; when $p$ is large and positive, $t$ is biased toward 0.
So when the packing factor is small the angle is biased toward |alpha|,
and when the packing factor is large the angle is biased toward |beta|.
(That's the forward case. The backward case is opposite.)

Ok, so there's a small trick here.  I want to avoid taking the logarithm
of zero, so I sample from $[0,1)$, and then subtract that from 1, and 
only then take the logarithm.  Still, I should probably check for errors

@@ A Graham scan works as follows.  We perform a single sweep of the points
in increasing polar coordinates, with ties broken as above.
During the sweep we maintain a stack of points that we propose to be
on the convex hull.  When considering a new point $w$, we push it
onto the stack and ask ``Is $u$ to
$v$ to $w$ a left hand turn?'', where $v$ is immediately below $w$ on the
stack, and
and $u$ is immediately below $v$.  If so, then we continue with the
next point.  If not, we remove $v$ and repeat the test.

As for starting and ending conditions, point |west| is an extremum, so
it must appear on the hull.  
The only tricky part is that we may have to reject several points near
the end of the |hull_buf| list because they may be the apex of a right
turn ending in |west|.  That explains the shenanigans with trying
to put |west| on the list twice.

@@ We need to implement the left-turn test.  This is well known.
See equation (3.4) of Preparata and Shamos, or 
the |ccw| test (counterclockwise) function in 
program GB\_PLANE of Knuth's Stanford GraphBase.  
The angle $uvw$ is a left turn if and only if 
$$\det \left(\matrix{ 
u_x & u_y & 1 \cr
v_x & v_y & 1 \cr
w_x & w_y & 1 \cr}\right) > 0.$$
This 3x3 determinant is equal to the 2x2 determinant
$$\det \left(\matrix{ 
u_x - w_x& u_y-w_y \cr
v_x - w_x& v_y-w_y \cr
}\right),$$
which saves us several multiplications.

Numerical analysts beware!

@@*Writing the output.
We're almost done.  
The component tree is built, but the subcomponents need
to be transformed.  

The convex hulls are now useless.  In fact, the pointers from the
subcomponents into |hull_vertex| are meaningless.   Before we
transform the coordinates, we must each of these hull pointers to something
minimal but harmless.  Recall that transforming a component 
eagerly transforms the hull.
